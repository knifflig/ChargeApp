    "## Introduction\n",
    "- A major part of energy system transformation is the transition of personal transport towards electric vehicles (EV)\n",
    "- Meanwhile this faces a classical chicken or egg problem as market acceptance is based on available (public) charging infrastructure while efficient allocation of resccources to those infrastructure depends on enough users [](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.retrec.2020.100837)\n",
    "- In Germany a great part of the populations have not the possiblity to install private charging devieces.\n",
    "- Lots of people dont life in houses with carport or garages and even if a major share does not own their living property\n",
    "- For making EV a viable alternative germany needs enough public charging stations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Charging infrastructure in germany\n",
    "- Gouverment see privat sector in charge to invest\n",
    "- at the moment about 80 to 90 thousand charging points\n",
    "- goal is 1 million until 2030 [](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/ladepunkte-in-deutschland-1884666)\n",
    "- Therefore the gouverment provides financial support for investors [](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/ladepunkte-in-deutschland-1884666)\n",
    "\n",
    "<-image here->\n",
    "## Growing demand\n",
    "- As this report by Roland Berger points out: While the energy transition proceeds more and more electric cars are on the roads \n",
    "- See image: The European light EV fleet should grow by 34% per year until 2050, reaching 227 million vehicles\n",
    "- At the same time numerous competitors try to find valubale business models to to match the growing demand of public infrastructure.\n",
    "- the main problem is here that EV drivers are (yet) highly unpredictable in their charging behaviors\n",
    "- The profitablity of charging stations depends highly on workload which is uneaven distributed [](https://doi.org/10.3390/wevj8040936)\n",
    "- Workload of german chargign stations is tracked in real time by the [Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur](https://nationale-leitstelle.de/verstehen/) (Charging infrastructure control centre) and ranges usually betwen 5% and 15%\n",
    "\n",
    "<-diagram here->\n",
    "## How to match the demand\n",
    "- for eficient ressource allocation well informed location determination is crucial\n",
    "- therefore we need:\n",
    "    + Predict the regional demand of public charging infrastructure based on:\n",
    "        - available charging stations\n",
    "        - private charging opportunities\n",
    "        - amount of cars\n",
    "        - traveled distances\n",
    "        - consumption per distance\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Predict usage behavior of different charger types based on small area factors:\n",
    "        - Traffic routes\n",
    "        - Traffic volatility\n",
    "        - length of stay\n",
    "        - housing structure\n",
    "        - periodic fluctuations\n",

    "- The ladestation-api [](https://github.com/bundesAPI/ladestationen-api) provided by the german gouvernment provides at the moment 46,196 stations which is not the full sample but will be enough to provide major insight\n",
    "- differences become clear when we look at two cities which are in the same regional context but show completly different patterns\n",
    "- while in Stuttgart aproximatly 750 charging stations  available for there 600k inhabitants Frankfurt have only 222 for 750k citizen"
