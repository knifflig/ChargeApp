## Introduction
- A major part of energy system transformation is the transition of personal transport towards electric vehicles (EV)
- Meanwhile this faces a classical chicken or egg problem as market acceptance is based on available (public) charging infrastructure while efficient allocation of resccources to those infrastructure depends on enough users
- In Germany a great part of the populations have not the possiblity to install private charging devieces.
- Lots of people dont life in houses with carport or garages and even if a major share does not own their living property
- For making EV a viable alternative germany needs enough public charging stations
